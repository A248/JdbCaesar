/**
 * An adapter to simplify converting Java objects to data in the database. <br>
 * <br>
 * Data type adapters are responsible for adapting the objects passed to {@link QueryBuilder#params(Object...)}
 * to the object which will be passed to the database via {@link PreparedStatement#setObject(int, Object)}. <br>
 * <br>
 * For each parameter passed to {@link QueryBuilder#params(Object...)}, the adapters configured
 * in the construction of JdbCaesar are called sequentially. As soon as the object returned by an adapter
 * is not referentially equal to the original object passed to the adapter, no more adapters are invoked
 * and the result of the adapter is used in {@link PreparedStatement#setObject(int, Object)}. <br>
 * <br>
 * Since implementations are called for <i>all</i> parameters, they should follow the pattern of checking
 * instanceof before returning a different result, like so: <br>
 * <pre>{@code (obj) -> (obj instanceof TargetType) ? ((TargetType) obj).getDatabaseRepresentation() : obj);}</pre> <br>
 * <br>
 * Additionally, implementations should be stateless and thread safe.
